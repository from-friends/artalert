## ðŸŸ¡ What is ArtAlert?

ArtAlert is an AI agent that monitors digital art marketplaces and delivers instant notifications based on your personalized alerts.

---

## âœ¨ Story

Iâ€™m a developer and digital art collector who was often missing out on new drops from my favorite artists, offers, and great NFT deals.  
To solve this, I built **ArtAlert**, your personal AI agent that continuously monitors digital art marketplaces and instantly sends notifications based on personalized alert lists.

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps & Future Vision

ArtAlert is a prototype built for the ShapecraftÂ² hackathon, but its potential extends far beyond. Here are some envisioned next steps:

- **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to personalize alerts and manage alert prompts.
- **Notification Channels**: Expand notification options to include custom webhooks, Push Notifications, Telegram, Discord, etc.
- **AI Agent Actions**: Enable the AI agent to act on behalf of the user. Purchase NFTs, accept offers, list artworks for sale, and more.
